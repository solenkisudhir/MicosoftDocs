> [!NOTE]
> In Azure Active Directory B2C, [custom policies](../articles/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview.md) are designed primarily to address complex scenarios. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use built-in [user flows](../articles/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview.md). If you've not done so, learn about custom policy starter pack in [Get started with custom policies in Active Directory B2C](../articles/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows.md).
