## Choose the right export option

There are two ways to export a template:

* **Export from resource group or resource**. This option generates a new template from existing resources. The exported template is a "snapshot" of the current state of the resource group. You can export an entire resource group or specific resources within that resource group.

* **Save from history**. This option retrieves an exact copy of a template used for deployment. You specify the deployment from the deployment history. 

Depending on the option you choose, the exported templates have different qualities.

| From resource group or resource | From history |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Template is autogenerated. You'll probably want to improve the code before deploying it. | Template is an exact copy of the one created by the template author. It's ready to be redeployed without any changes. |
| Template is snapshot of the resources' current state. It includes any manual changes you made after deployment. | Template only shows state of resources at the time of deployment. Any manual changes you made after deployment aren't included. |
| You can select which resources from a resource group to export. | All resources for a specific deployment are included. You can't pick a subset of those resources or add resources that were added at a different time. |
| Template includes all properties for the resources, including some properties you wouldn't normally set during deployment. You might want to remove or clean up these properties before reusing the template. | Template includes only the properties needed for the deployment. The template is more sparse and easier to read. |
| Template probably doesn't include all of the parameters you need for reuse. Most property values are hard-coded in the template. To redeploy the template in other environments, you need to add parameters that increase the ability to configure the resources.  You can unselect **Include parameters** so that you can author your own parameters. | Template includes parameters that make it easy to redeploy in different environments. |

Export the template from a resource group or resource, when:

* You need to capture changes to the resources that were made after the original deployment.
* You want to select which resources are exported.
* The resources weren't created with a template.

Export the template from the history, when:

* You want an easy-to-reuse template.
* You don't need to include changes you made after the original deployment.
