> To deploy a template or reference a linked template that is stored in a private GitHub repo, see a custom solution documented in [Creating a Custom and Secure Azure Portal Offering](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-architecture-blog/creating-a-custom-and-secure-azure-portal-offering/ba-p/3038344). You can create an [Azure function](../articles/azure-functions/functions-overview.md) that pulls the GitHub token out of Azure Key Vault.
