## Upload your model

Before you run the app, you'll need to make your models available to the app.
If you don't already have an Object Anchors model, follow the instructions in [Create a model](../articles/object-anchors/quickstarts/get-started-model-conversion.md) to create one. Then, return here.

With your HoloLens powered on and connected to the development device (PC), follow these steps to upload a model to the **3D Objects** folder on your HoloLens:

1. Select and copy the models you want to work with by pressing Ctrl key and C together (Ctrl + C).

2. Press Windows Logo key and E together (Win + E) to launch File Explorer. You should see your HoloLens listed with other drives and folders on the left pane.

3. Tap on the HoloLens link to show the storage on the HoloLens device on the right pane.

4. In File Explorer, go to **Internal Storage > 3D Objects**. Now, you can paste your models in the **3D Objects** folder by pressing Ctrl key and V together (Ctrl + V).
