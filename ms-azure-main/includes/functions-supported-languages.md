::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
The following table shows the runtime and language versions supported for C# functions. Select your preferred development language at the top of the article. 

The supported version of .NET depends on both your Functions runtime version and your chosen .NET worker process model:

### [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with [supported versions of .NET and .NET Framework](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#supported-versions). To learn more, see [Develop .NET isolated worker process functions](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

### [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

Your function code runs in the same process as the Functions host process. Supports only [Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md#supported-versions). To learn more, see [Develop .NET class library functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md).
