> [!NOTE]
> Although Microsoft recommends general-purpose v2 accounts for most scenarios, Microsoft will continue to support general-purpose v1 accounts for new and existing customers. You can create general-purpose v1 storage accounts in new regions whenever Azure Storage is available in those regions. Microsoft does not currently have a plan to deprecate support for general-purpose v1 accounts and will provide at least one year's advance notice before deprecating any Azure Storage feature. Microsoft will continue to provide security updates for general-purpose v1 accounts, but no new feature development is expected for this account type.
>
> For new Azure regions that have come online after October 1, 2020, pricing for general-purpose v1 accounts has changed and is equivalent to pricing for general-purpose v2 accounts in those regions. Pricing for general-purpose v1 accounts in Azure regions that existed prior to October 1, 2020 has not changed. For pricing details for general-purpose v1 accounts in a specific region, see the Azure Storage pricing page. Choose your region, and then next to **Pricing offers**, select **Other**.
