## Set expiration

It's also possible to configure your anchor to expire automatically at a given date in the future. When an anchor expires, it will no longer be located or updated. Expiration can only be set when the anchor is created, before saving it to the cloud. Updating expiration afterwards isn't possible. If no expiration is set during anchor creation, the anchor will only expire when [deleted manually](../articles/spatial-anchors/how-tos/create-locate-anchors-unity.md#delete-anchors).
