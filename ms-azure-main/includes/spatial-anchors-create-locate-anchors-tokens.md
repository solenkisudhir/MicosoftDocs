### Microsoft Entra authentication

Azure Spatial Anchors also allows applications to authenticate with user Microsoft Entra ID (Active Directory) tokens. For example, you can use Microsoft Entra tokens to integrate with Azure Spatial Anchors. If an Enterprise maintains users in Microsoft Entra ID, you can supply a user Microsoft Entra token in the Azure Spatial Anchors SDK. Doing so allows you to authenticate directly to the Azure Spatial Anchors service for an account that's part of the same Microsoft Entra tenant.
