## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.
    
This command starts a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools.
