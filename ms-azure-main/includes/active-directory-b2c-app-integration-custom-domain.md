## Use a custom domain

By using a [custom domain](../articles/active-directory-b2c/custom-domain.md), you can fully brand the authentication URL. From a user perspective, users remain on your domain during the authentication process, rather than being redirected to the Azure AD B2C b2clogin.com domain name.

To remove all references to "b2c" in the URL, you can also replace your B2C tenant name, contoso.onmicrosoft.com, in the authentication request URL with your tenant ID GUID. For example, you can change `https://fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/` to `https://account.contosobank.co.uk/<tenant ID GUID>/`.
