> [!IMPORTANT]
> The next steps show you how to build your custom policy XML files. We recommend that you use a **[sample Custom email verification](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/samples/tree/master/policies/custom-email-verifcation-displaycontrol/policy)** custom policy available on GitHub. `DisplayControl_TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml` uses `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml` as its base file hence make sure to include `TrustFrameworkBase.xml`, `TrustFrameworkLocalization.xml` and `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml` files from the **SocialAndLocalAccounts** [starter pack](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack) in your policy.
