> This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference-node.md). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](../articles/azure-functions/functions-node-upgrade-v4.md).
