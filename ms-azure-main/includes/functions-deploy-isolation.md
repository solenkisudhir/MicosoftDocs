Azure App Service Environment (ASE) provides a dedicated hosting environment in which to run your functions. ASE lets you configure a single front-end gateway that you can use to authenticate all incoming requests. For more information, see [Configuring a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for App Service Environment](../articles/app-service/environment/integrate-with-application-gateway.md).
