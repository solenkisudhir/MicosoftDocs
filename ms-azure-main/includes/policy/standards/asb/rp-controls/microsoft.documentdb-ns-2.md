|[Azure Cosmos DB accounts should have firewall rules](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F862e97cf-49fc-4a5c-9de4-40d4e2e7c8eb) |Firewall rules should be defined on your Azure Cosmos DB accounts to prevent traffic from unauthorized sources. Accounts that have at least one IP rule defined with the virtual network filter enabled are deemed compliant. Accounts disabling public access are also deemed compliant. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cosmos%20DB/Cosmos_NetworkRulesExist_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Cosmos DB should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F797b37f7-06b8-444c-b1ad-fc62867f335a) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that your CosmosDB account isn't exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of your CosmosDB account.

|[CosmosDB accounts should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F58440f8a-10c5-4151-bdce-dfbaad4a20b7) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your CosmosDB account, data leakage risks are reduced.
