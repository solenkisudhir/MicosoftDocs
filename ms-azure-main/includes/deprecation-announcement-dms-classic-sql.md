> **[Azure Database Migration Service (classic) - SQL scenarios are on a deprecation path](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/retirement-azure-database-migration-service-classic-sql-server-scenarios-deprecation/)**. Since **August 1, 2023**, you're no longer able to create new Database Migration Service (classic) resources for SQL Server scenarios from Azure portal. The service will be retired on **March 15, 2026** for all customers. You can migrate to Azure SQL Database using the latest version of [Azure Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/dmslatest), which is available as an extension in Azure Data Studio, or by using [Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI](/azure/dms/migration-dms-powershell-cli). For more information, see [Retirement notice: Database Migration Service (classic)](https://aka.ms/dmsclassicportal).
