# Project “Sophia” overview (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Project “Sophia” is a new generation of AI-first business app that helps users with complex, cross functional tasks, and offers a new way to discover, visualize, and interact with business data. 

Project “Sophia” offers an AI- powered, user-friendly research canvas and large language model powered blueprints. The research canvas helps you create exploratory journeys and understand business data with AI-generated charts and insights without the need to manually mine data and create visuals. The app provides quick insights and recommends the next steps. You can start with a question and explore different options and can continue to iterate until you get the best possible outcome. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Project “Sophia” is available only in the United States region.
> - While Project "Sophia" is based on large language models that work with multiple languages, the product has been validated only in the English (United States) language. Other languages are currently not supported.
> - This is a preview feature. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Waiting room

If Project "Sophia" reaches its full capacity during the preview period, you're placed in a waiting room queue until there's more capacity. You can remain in the waiting room or sign up to be notified when Project "Sophia" is available to everyone without getting redirected to the waiting room. 


> [!Note]
> If you choose to stay in the waiting room, don't refresh your browser as this will put you at the back of the queue.

## Authenticated and unauthenticated experience

If you don't sign in to Project "Sophia", you can't ask questions or upload any data. However, you can still access a limited unauthenticated experience where you can use sample data and get a feel for Project "Sophia", and view suggested next steps.
