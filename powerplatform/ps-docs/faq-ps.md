# Frequently asked questions about Project “Sophia” (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

## 1. Why can't I access Project  “Sophia"?
Project "Sophia" is only available in the United States. If you're trying to access it while you're in the United States and still get a notification stating **Project Sophia is not yet available your region**, then it's because the data residency of the tenant you're trying to access from is based outside of North America. You can sign up for product news and to be notified when Project "Sophia" is available in new regions, [here](https://aka.ms/projectsophianews). 

## 2. Can I provide feedback to the product team?
Submit your feedback on Project “Sophia", [here](https://aka.ms/projectsophiafeedback).

## 3. Why do I get an error when trying to upload a file?
You can upload a PDF (.pdf), CSV (.csv), and Excel (.xls) file. For more information, see [Supported data files and limitations](ask-question.md#supported-data-files).


## 4. The page never loads when I select next actions:
This might happen if you select multiple **next actions** while a previous next action is loading. We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix in an upcoming release, but until then select **cancel** and try the action again.

## 5. How can I refine a single block instead of the entire blueprint?
If you're using the AI cursor and press enter after entering your prompt, your prompt will automatically create a new blueprint. You can choose to update only a single block on a blueprint by selecting **Generate** and then select **Generate in place of existing block**. This replaces or updates the content of an existing block based on the content you enter.

## 6. Can I connect to data instead of uploading files? 
No, but we plan to support connecting to your enterprise data in future releases.

## 7. What are the preview terms? Is Microsoft using my data to train their models? How do I know my data is safe?

The use of Project "Sophia" is subject to the terms outlined in, see [Preview terms](https://aka.ms/projectsophiapreviewterms).
